# It accepts the following arguments:
#   the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile;
#   the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr.
# It creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating 
# the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
